# HOW TO SUBMIT A BOSS FOR PLAYER TO FIGHT

## There are five kinds ov submission
We are currently only accepting submissions in JavaScript! To add a Maze Room
just download the buildingPack { instructions on where to download should be a
self-made system using AWS }. Put boss and segmentedBoss on top ov that if you
want to make a Boss Fight.

If your boss requires a special tool to be defeated, you might need to add a
Vault Keeper. Otherwise, if there's just a small Challenge you player has to
face for their own benefit before fighting your boss, you can also add a
Mud Room.

If you want to make a Maze Room.

A MAZE ROOM is submitted as a string or an array ov strings, and can be made
without any coding knowledge. Something like this:

[
"
____________
__XX____XX__
__XX____XX__
XXXXXX__XXXX
__XX____XX__
_XXXXXXXXXX_
",
"
____________
________XX__
________XX__
__XXX___XXXX
__XX____XX__
_XXXXXXXXXX_
",
]

That Maze's size is {x: 12, y: 2, z: 6}.

The player has to complete one relatively easy maze between every time they
fights a boss. TO SUBMIT A BOSS:

Making a Boss Fight requires some JavaScript knowledge. Here the submitter can
submit either a boss or a segmentedBoss, and produce the according function.
Making a boss function requires a series ov special objects, and making one with
a segmentedBoss requires webpack.

A Boss Fight comes with a Treasure Room, the fifth kind ov submission. It's
required to come with a boss and is the way that the players let the system
know what they think about whether other players should be likely to have to
fight that boss, and how good those players should have to be to fight it.

The players who take all the treasure from every Treasure Room gain special
abilities faster than those who don't, but not points. They also effectively
give up their vote, choosing to be successful rather than influential.
